Your job is to write two more versions of the Ngrams class. The
source file names will hint at how the Ngrams class is implemented.
For example, you might put a new version of the Ngrams class in
NgramsArray.h and NgramsArray.C.

To cause make to compile this new version, you'll need to
add this to the makefile:

NgramArray:
	-rm Ngrams.C
	-rm Ngrams.h
	ln -s NgramArray.C Ngrams.C
	ln -s NgramArray.h Ngrams.h
	make all

To compile it, type:
make NgramArray

To see if it works, type:
./ngramcheck.sh short
./ngramcheck.sh shakespeare1000Lines
./ngramcheck.sh shakespeare5000Lines
./ngramcheck.sh shakespeare9000Lines

To see how fast it runs, type:
./profile.pl NgramArray

You need to create two versions, one that uses the
C standard template library and one that does not.
The two versions that will be used for grading 
are identified by the commands and the V1 and V2
targets in the makefile:

V1:
	make NgramArray

V2:
	make NgramBetterLinkedList

To see what your grade is, type:
./driver.pl

Good Luck!
